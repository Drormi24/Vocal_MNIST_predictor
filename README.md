# Vocal_MNIST_predictor
This project objective is to predict voice content by converting it from an audio signal to an image and run it through a Convolution Neural Network (CNN).

Raw dataset is based on Free Spoken Digit Data (FSDD) dataset by: Zohar Jackson, CÃ©sar Souza, Jason Flaks, Yuxin Pan, Hereman Nicolas, & Adhish Thite. (2018).
Jakobovski/free-spoken-digit-dataset: v1.0.8 (v1.0.8). Zenodo. https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1342401
audio file structure and naming: .wav file named 8_dror_0.wav where 8 is the files class / label, dror is authors name and 0 is a serial number of file.

Main process: take audio .wav file --> convert it from continuous signal to a descrete frequencies distribution using Fast Furier Transform --> represnt audio in a spectrogram image of frequencies over time --> convert spectrogram images to numeric representation and cranch it in a CNN training procedure to get a digit written identification of its FSDD audio file.

Side process: run_your_audio is doing the same conversion from an audio to an image but using CNN as a predicition tool.

# Structure:
main.py is the main code for processing FSDD dataset and CNN training.
data is a folder with an audio files zipped dataset (3000 files).
audio_images is a folder with created images in .jpg format and 'audio_image0.jpg' naming.
utils is a folder with few sub-folders:
1. my_model: trained CNN model params, weights etc.
2. WAV2IMG.py: functions file with .wav files read, display and convert to spectrogram image.
3. WAV_DIR_2_IMG_DIR.py: function file for audio files reading and handling and data preprations for CNN run.
4. CNN_model.py: functions for defining CNN model strucutre and its hyperparams, and for train-test spliting dataset.
